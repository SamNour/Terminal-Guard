# Terminal-Guard
Terminal-Guard is a minimalistic Pseudo-Terminal (PTY) that controls interactive programs. It gives the user complete control over the interactions between the Parent-Child processes. The PTY is totally controlled by a -YAML configuration file written in lua.

The tool is aimed to be used for security and linux education; it is inspired by applications like https://overthewire.org/wargames/, but gives the developer much more flexibility due to its design.

*Disclaimer, the source code provided is only an older version of the tool, updated branches will be available in August 2024 for copyright requirements; for more information, contact sam.nour@tum.de*.
